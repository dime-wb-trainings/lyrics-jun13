My shadow side, so amplified
Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary, son, but it's soul
My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent, why do you care?
Someone start the car
Time to go
You're the best I know

My sunny side has up and died
I'm betting now where we collide
The universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen
Are treating you like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro

My, what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to get to know you a little better baby
God knows that I really have tried
My what a good day for a take-out bride
I'd like to say we did it for the better, oh

I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary, son, but it's soul
The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty going toe-to-toe

My, what a good day for a, let it slide
I'd like to say we did it for the better, oh

I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated, but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter, yeah

Right on the verge, just one more dose
I'm traveling from coast to coast
My theory isn't perfect, but it's close
I'm almost there, why should I care?
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up, let it show

My what a good day for a, walk outside
I'd like to think we did it for the better, oh

I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter

Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
I do

Yeah
You don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
I do
Yeah
